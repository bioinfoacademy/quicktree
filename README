QuickTree 1.0
=============

QuickTree generates phylogentic trees using the Neighbor-Joining
algorithm. The tress are written to stdout, in the Newick/Hew
Hampshire format. 

QuickTree accepts both distance matrix and multiple-sequence-aligment
inputs. The former should be in PHYLIP format. The latter should be in
Stockholm format, which is the native alignment format for the Pfam
database. Alignments in various formats can be converted to Stockholm
format by the sreformat program, which is part of the HMMer package by
Sean Eddy (hmmer.wustl.edu).
